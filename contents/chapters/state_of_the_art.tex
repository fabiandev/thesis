\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{cha:state-of-the-art}

This chapter's main focus is on TypeScript, while also other supersets are explored. Furthermore, the current state of runtime type validations in JavaScript is highlighted, and the status of automatically generating type checks based on TypeScript code is discussed.

\section{JavaScript Supersets}
\label{sec:supersets}

\citeauthor{Term:Superset} defines a \emph{superset} as 
\begin{quote}
   [a] set containing all elements of a smaller set. If $B$ is a subset of $A$, then $A$ is a superset of $B$ [...].~\cite{Term:Superset}
\end{quote}
This means that every program that is valid in JavaScript is also legal in a JavaScript superset, where the purpose of such a superset can be to add features to the original language. As the source written in the supersets syntax will be compiled to JavaScript, any additional functionality needs to be representable as JavaScript code as well.

\subsection{TypeScript}
\label{sec:typescript}

TypeScript was created by Anders Hejlsberg---the designer of C\texttt{\#}---at Microsoft~\cite[p.~10]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2017} and was released in 2012 under the \emph{Apache}\footnote{\url{https://www.apache.org}} open source license version 2.0\footnote{\url{https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}}~\cite[p.~xix]{ProTypeScript:Fenton:2014}. The most important aspect of TypeScript is that it includes a compilation step where static type checking is performed~\cite[p.~11]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2017}. Type annotations are optional and the compiler will infer type information where possible~\cite[p.~10]{TypeScriptBook:Syed:2017}. TypeScript also introduces concepts known from other programming languages, such as interfaces and enumerations (i.e., enums). Not only it is possible to develop a program in the TypeScript syntax, but also to add type annotations to existing JavaScript projects~\cite[p.~13]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2017}. The most significant particularities and features are be explored in this section.

\subsubsection{Basic Types}

TypeScript defines a set of basic types, which overlap with JavaScript's types, listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:value-types}, while also introducing several new ones, as listed below~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:BasicTypes}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Tuple} is a special kind of an array, only allowing a fixed number of elements.
  \item \emph{Enum} may already be known from other programming languages, like Java, and is useful to define a set of values.
  \item \emph{Any} results in type checking not being performed by the compiler. This can be of advantage when using TypeScript alongside third party libraries where no type definitions are available.
  \item \emph{Void} is the counterpart to \emph{Any}. Again, it is used in other languages, e.g., to annotate functions that do not return a value. In TypeScript also variables may be typed as \texttt{void}, meaning that only \texttt{undefined} or \texttt{null} are accepted as value.
  \item \emph{Never}, for instance, is useful for functions that always throw an error or result in an infinite loop, as no value will ever come back.
\end{itemize}
While other types, such as \emph{Function}, or more advanced structures are also available, the ones listed above in combination with those already defined in JavaScript (i.e., \emph{Undefined}, \emph{Null}, \emph{Boolean}, \emph{String}, \emph{Symbol}, \emph{Number}, and \emph{Object}) are frequently seen in TypeScript projects.

\subsubsection{Type Inference}

As already mentioned, TypeScript tries to infer the type if no type annotation is provided. The example below shows a variable declaration in JavaScript (or TypeScript), where the TypeScript compiler can automatically infer the type \emph{Number} from the declaration:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
let num = 1;
\end{JsCode}
Therefore it won't allow any subsequent assignment to \texttt{num} not being a number. For example the reassignment \texttt{num = "foo"} would result in the following compiler diagnostic:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
Type '"foo"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
\end{JsCode}
The term \emph{diagnostic} is used over \emph{error} here, since the compiler won't stop in such cases and will try to emit the final JavaScript code by default~\cite[p.~12]{TypeScriptBook:Syed:2017}:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
let num = 1;
num = "foo";
\end{JsCode}
The code above shows the compiled result, even though the compiler detected a type error.

\enlargethispage{1\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{Type Annotations}

While type inference can be useful in some situations, others require types to be set explicitly, as shown below:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
let num: number;
num = 1;
\end{JsCode}
The variable \texttt{num} is declared, but not initialized, requiring  a type annotation in order to be treated as a number by TypeScript. Omitting the explicit type information, the compiler would infer the \emph{Any} type, allowing arbitrary assignments to the variable.

\subsubsection{Type Assertions}

Type assertions are a way to provide TypeScript with type information, which is not available to the compiler. They are like
\begin{quote}
  [...] type [casts] in other languages, but [perform] no special checking or restructuring of data.~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:BasicTypes}
\end{quote}
It is the developer who needs to take care of performing sufficient checks when using a type assertion. Because of the possibility to use any existing JavaScript library with TypeScript, situations where the compiler does not have type information of the external package may occur. Type assertions can be a solution to prevent compile time type errors in such cases:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
import RandomName from "random-name";
let name: string = (RandomName as any).getName();
\end{JsCode}
In the example above the default export from the library \texttt{random-name} is imported as \texttt{RandomName}. This package is neither written in TypeScript nor does it have type definitions available. However, the library has a callable \texttt{getName} property, returning a string. As the compiler is not aware of the package's properties and their return types, it is necessary to provide the information which type to assert. \texttt{RandomName} is casted to \texttt{any}, allowing property access independently of their existence. Again, because of type assertions (or type casts) not performing any special checking, this solution may lead to errors if the author of the package decides to change its \emph{application programming interface} (i.e., API). Therefore manually checking for a callable \texttt{getName} property on \texttt{RandomName}, as well as verifying the returned value, is recommended.
As an alternative to the type casting syntax with the \texttt{as} keyword, the following may be used:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
let name: string = (<any>RandomName).getName();
\end{JsCode}
However, the \emph{angle-bracket} syntax shown above is not supported when using TypeScript with \emph{JSX}\footnote{``JSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax [...] meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript [which] came to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other applications as well''~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:JSX}.}~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:BasicTypes}, making the \texttt{as} syntax preferable.

\subsubsection{Ambient Type Declarations}

In TypeScript either existing structures---such as classes and basic types---can be used as type annotation, or they can be defined via interfaces or type aliases. The latter are not part of the code after compilation, while, e.g., classes or enums remain in the JavaScript code. Anyway, it is also possible to declare, among others, a class or variable as ambient in TypeScript. This may be useful when consuming a third party package, which is not written in TypeScript, and no type definitions are available for the library. In the previous section type casting was used to circumvent this issue. While this is a possibility, it may not be suitable if the library is used frequently in a project. Prepending, e.g., a variable, class, namespace, or an enum with the \texttt{declare} keyword, results in the declaration being ambient:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
declare const RandomName: any;
\end{JsCode}
\pagebreak
Alternatively the imported package may be described more detailed:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
declare const RandomName: {
  getName: () => string;
};
\end{JsCode}
From now on the TypeScript compiler can obtain the information of the import having a callable property \texttt{getName}, which returns a string. However, the declaration will not be part of the compiled JavaScript program.

\enlargethispage{1\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{Structural Types}

Types in TypeScript are structural~\cite[p.~11]{TypeScriptBook:Syed:2017}, meaning that the type checker looks at the members of an object, or more specifically its type signature, to ensure type compatibility, while other major languages, such as C\texttt{\#} or Java, use nominal type systems~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:TypeCompatibility}. Prog.~\ref{prog:structural-typing} gives an example, which would fail in a nominally typed language, but is possible in the structurally typed language TypeScript.

\begin{program}[h]
\caption{An instance of \texttt{Person} can be assigned to a variable with type \texttt{Named} on line~\ref{prog:structural-typing:instance}, because of TypeScript's structural type system. In languages with a nominal type system the class \texttt{Person} would need to implement the interface \texttt{Named} in their corresponding syntax, for this example to be valid.~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:TypeCompatibility}}
\label{prog:structural-typing}
\begin{JsCode}
interface Named {
    name: string;
}

class Person {
    name: string;
}

let p: Named;
p = new Person(); /+\label{prog:structural-typing:instance}+/
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

\subsubsection{Classes}

TypeScript not only enables static type checking for JavaScript applications, but it also adds language features. While EcmaScript 2015 introduced classes, TypeScript provides the enhancement to also define them as abstract, and to add visibility modifiers and interfaces to them, as shown below:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
class Person implements Human {
  public name: string;
  private age: number;
}
\end{JsCode}
The keywords \texttt{public}, \texttt{protected} and \texttt{private} may be used for class members and methods. Also it is possible to define members and to provide default values outside of the constructor, as well as to mark properties as \texttt{readonly}, which prohibits reassignments at compile time:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
class Person implements Human {
  public readonly id = uid();
}
\end{JsCode}
Anyway, it is important to note that the modifiers described, as well as implemented interfaces, are only relevant during compile time. After the final JavaScript code has been emitted, this information is missing and cannot be used in the running program:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.id = uid();
  }
}
\end{JsCode}
Consequently, it is technically possible to assign an arbitrary value to \texttt{id} property of a \texttt{Person} instance at runtime.

\subsubsection{Enums}

Enumerations are beneficial for defining a set of values. The TypeScript compiler takes enum declarations and transforms them into runnable JavaScript code. Given is the following enum in TypeScript syntax:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
enum HairColor {
  Black, Blond, Brown, Red, Other
}
\end{JsCode}
This results in the JavaScript code below, which shows a self-executing function, initializing the identifier \texttt{HairColor} with the data of the enumeration:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
var HairColor;
(function (HairColor) {
    HairColor[HairColor["Black"] = 0] = "Black";
    HairColor[HairColor["Blond"] = 1] = "Blond";
    // ...
})(HairColor || (HairColor = {}));
\end{JsCode}
The enum keys can now be accessed at runtime to obtain their corresponding values. Also it is possible to reveal a key by its value:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
HairColor.Black // 0
HairColor[0] // "Black"
\end{JsCode}
However, if the enumeration is declared as constant, the compiler will look up the numeric value and will insert it directly into the source code, before entirely removing its definition~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:Enums}, unless the compiler option \emph{preserveConstEnums} is used~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:CompilerOptions}.

\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{Namespaces}

In TypeScript, namespaces provide a possibility to encapsulate code. They were previously referred to as \emph{internal modules}, but have since been renamed to avoid confusion with native \emph{modules} of the EcmaScript standard, previously denoted as \emph{external modules} in TypeScript~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:Namespaces}.
Code within a namespace only exposes its explicitly exported parts:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
namespace Capsule {
  let foo = "Hello from Capsule!";
  
  export function bar() {
    return foo;
  }
}
\end{JsCode}
Accessing \texttt{foo} of the namespace \texttt{Capsule} would result in \texttt{undefined}, whereas calling \texttt{bar} would return the value of \texttt{foo}. If taking a look at the JavaScript code generated from the namespace above, this behavior is made clear:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
var Capsule;
(function (Capsule) {
    var foo = "Hello from Capsule!";
    function bar() {
        return foo;
    }
    Capsule.bar = bar;
})(Capsule || (Capsule = {}));
\end{JsCode}
A variable with the name of the namespace is declared and an empty object is assigned to it. Only the namespace's exported parts will be added to this object to be exposed, while all other values 
remain exclusively accessible from within the self-executing function itself.

\subsubsection{Parameter Default Values}

Another useful feature is the possibility to define default values for parameters in TypeScript. This gives developers the ability to avoid parameters being \texttt{undefined} if not passed, and can be useful in various other scenarios.
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
function log(message: string, logger: Console = console) {
  logger.log(message);
}
\end{JsCode}
The example shows a function, which writes a string to the console when omitting the second parameter. If another log mechanism is desired, it is possible to pass a different logger to this method, which aligns with the \texttt{Console} interface. The compiled JavaScript code is shown below:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
function log(message, logger) {
    if (logger === void 0) { logger = console; }
    logger.log(message);
}
\end{JsCode}
If the parameter \texttt{logger} equals \texttt{undefined}, which is the value that is returned by \mbox{\texttt{void 0}}\footnote{The void operator can be used to retrieve the value \texttt{undefined} by calling \texttt{void(0)}, which is equivalent to \texttt{void 0}~\cite{void:MDN:2017}.}, the global variable \texttt{console} will be assigned to it. Otherwise the parameter passed to the function \texttt{log} will be used as is.

\enlargethispage{1\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{Future JavaScript}

While the TypeScript compiler can target different JavaScript versions---such as ES3, ES5, and ES2015---it does also support future ECMAScript proposals, like decorators and asynchronous functions~\cites{TypeScriptHandbook:CompilerOptions, TypeScriptWebsite}, allowing the use of features which are possibly not yet implemented in various JavaScript engines. This is achieved by changing parts of the source, or by including additional code that mimics the behavior of a certain feature and delivers the same result. The code below uses a pattern, referred to as \emph{destructuring assignment}~\cite{DestructuringAssignment:Mozilla:2015}, to assign the values \texttt{1} and \texttt{2} to the identifiers \texttt{foo} and \texttt{bar}, respectively:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
let [ foo, bar ] = [1, 2];  
\end{JsCode}
While this line would remain unchanged when targeting the ES2015 standard or later, where the \emph{array binding pattern} is already specified~\cite[p.~198]{ES6Spec:Ecma:2015}, the outcome is different for ES5 and below:
\begin{JsCode}[numbers=none]
var _a = [1, 2], foo = _a[0], bar = _a[1];
\end{JsCode}
As the pattern is not part of the fifth edition of ECMAScript~\cite{ES5Spec:Ecma:2015}, the compiler substitutes it with an alternative implementation.
 
\subsection{Flow}
\label{sec:flow}

\emph{Flow}\footnote{\url{https://flow.org}} is an open source static type checker for JavaScript, developed by \emph{Facebook}\footnote{\url{https://code.facebook.com}}~\cite{FacebookCode:Flow}. The most noticeable difference to TypeScript is the lack of an extensive compiler provided by the project itself. Instead, Flow relies on \emph{Babel}\footnote{\url{https://babeljs.io}}, a compiler for JavaScript~\cite{BabelWebsite}, which ``[...] will take [...] Flow code and strip out any type annotations''~\cite{FlowDocs:Install}. Alternatively the library \emph{flow-remove-types}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/flowtype/flow-remove-types}} can be used~\cite{FlowDocs:Install}.

Another difference between the two JavaScript supersets are their design goals. While TypeScript's goal is not to ``apply a sound or "provably correct" type system [but to] strike a balance between correctness and productivity''~\cite{TypeScriptWiki:DesignGoals}, Flow's type system ``[...] tries to be as sound and complete as possible''~\cite{FlowDocs:TypesAndExpressions}. The syntax itself is mostly identical to the one of TypeScript~\cite{FlowDocs:TypesAnnotations}. Brzóska sums up the differences between the two languages, as shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:typescript-flow}.

\subsection{Others}
\label{sec:other-supersets}

%There are a multitude of extensions available for JavaScript. In \cite{LanguagesThatCompileToJS:CoffeeScript:2017} an extensive list of languages that compile to JavaScript, JavaScript supersets, parsers and compilers can be found. That list includes \emph{CoffeeScript\footnote{\url{http://coffeescript.org}}}---a ``[...] language that compiles into JavaScript''~\cite{CoffeeScript}---as well as the static type checkers \emph{TypeScript\footnote{\url{https://www.typescriptlang.org}}} and \emph{Flow\footnote{\url{https://flow.org}}}. Languages that have packages available for transforming its code to JavaScript include, but are not limited to, \emph{Ruby}, \emph{Python}, \emph{Java}, \emph{Scala} and \emph{C\texttt{\#}}.
%
%In~\cite{LanguagesThatCompileToJS:CoffeeScript:2017} an extensive list can be found, 

%Apart from TypeScript and Flow, a multitude of languages exist that compile to JavaScript, some of them being supersets, with different purposes. The \emph{CoffeeScript\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript}}} project collected an extensive list, containing the following maintained languages they refer to as supersets~\cite{LanguagesToJavaScript}:

Apart from TypeScript and Flow, there are a variety of other languages that compile to JavaScript for different purposes. In~\cite{LanguagesThatCompileToJS:CoffeeScript} an extensive list of JavaScript supersets, parsers, and compilers can be found, containing the following maintained languages they refer to as superset:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{JavaScript\texttt{++}:} This superset supports classes, type checking, and other features.
  \item \textbf{Objective-J:} This language has the same relationship to JavaScript, as \emph{Objective-C} to \emph{C}.
  %\item \textbf{Six:} Supports features from the 6th edition of ECMAScript through a transpiler
  %\item \textbf{Latte JS:} Similar to CoffeeScript with JavaScript syntax
  \item \textbf{JSX:} JSX got popular with the \emph{React}\footnote{\url{https://facebook.github.io/react/}} framework~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:JSX} and adds XML-like syntax to represent HTML elements in JavaScript.
  \item \textbf{oj:} This is an \emph{Objective-C} inspired superset with an experimental type checker.
\end{itemize}
The collection also contains languages like \emph{Scala.js}\footnote{\url{http://www.scala-js.org}}, which compiles \emph{Scala}\footnote{\url{http://scala-lang.org}} code to JavaScript, or \emph{Opal}\footnote{\url{http://opalrb.org}}, a \emph{Ruby}\footnote{\url{https://www.ruby-lang.org}} to JavaScript compiler.

\section{Runtime Type Checks}
\label{sec:runtime-type-checks}

%The situations discussed in the previous sections of this chapter raised the concern of negligently or unknowingly opting out of static type checks for specific parts of the code or of providing insufficient or wrong type declaration, which may cause the compiler to miss incompatible types. These situation may be discoverable at runtime, if runtime type checks would be employed alongside compile time checks.

%As already mentioned in section~\ref{sec:typescript},
Type annotations are removed for the compiled JavaScript program in TypeScript and no additional code is introduced to add checks at runtime. The removal of types is intended and is defined in the design goals\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals}} of the language:
\begin{quote}
  [Do not] add or rely on runtime type information in programs,
  or emit different code based on the results of the type system.
  Instead, encourage programming patterns that do not require runtime metadata.~\cite{TypeScriptWiki:DesignGoals}
\end{quote}
Anyway, runtime type information and validation can be useful in several situations. 
For example they can give more accurate error messages during development and can 
draw attention to issues, which are not observable during compile time.
There are proposals to expose type information to the runtime and to add runtime type
checks, in the TypeScript community~\cites{TypeScriptIssue:RuntimeTypeChecking, TypeScriptIssue:RuntimeTypeChecks, TypeScriptIssue:EmitTypeArguments}. Regardless of the demand, these features won't be added, as they are out of scope
for TypeScript~\cite{TypeScriptIssue:RuntimeTypeChecking:Comment:OutOfScope, TypeScriptIssue:EmitTypeArguments:Comment:OutOfScope}.
Currently, manually added type checks are required to identify and to easily trace errors during development. Prog.~\ref{prog:js-without-typechecks} shows a JavaScript function, which only takes up three lines of code, while Prog.~\ref{prog:js-with-typechecks} outlines a function---also in native JavaScript---with the same outcome but with added type checks, which now requires 13 lines of code.

\begin{program}[h]
\caption{A JavaScript function without type checks.}
\label{prog:js-without-typechecks}
\begin{JsCode}
function sum(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((a, b) =>  a + b);
}
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}
\begin{program}
\caption{The JavaScript function from Prog.~\ref{prog:js-without-typechecks} with type checks.}
\label{prog:js-with-typechecks}
\begin{JsCode}
function sum(arr) {
  if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {
    throw new TypeError("array expected");
  }
  
  return arr.reduce((a, b) => {
    if (typeof b !== "number") {
      throw new TypeError("number expected");
    }
    
    return a + b;
  });
}
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

\noindent
While these examples outline the verification of primitive types, like a number or an array, inspecting an object is more complex. Instances may be checked with the \texttt{instanceof} operator, which ``[...] tests whether an object in its prototype chain has the prototype property of a constructor''~\cite{instanceof:MDN:2017}, however, interfaces and type alias are removed by the TypeScript compiler, therefore this kind of verification method is not possible for such cases.

\pagebreak
\noindent
To get around this issue, \citeauthor{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2015} describes three different techniques to employ type checks for the runtime environment:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reflection:} The prototype of a JavaScript object holds 
some information about the object, which can be accessed. It might, for instance, contain the name of the constructor function, used to create the object. Limitations apply, since various information is only available from ECMAScript 5.1, or may not be available at all~\cite[pp.~98--100]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2015}. Also the name of a constructor is not always suitable to categorize an object as a type, as the same name may also be used for a different constructor function, while anonymous functions do not have a name at all. Simply obtaining the name is also not sufficient to check for implemented interfaces, or type aliases, as they are compiled away by TypeScript.
  \item \textbf{Checking an object for a property:} An object could be considered 
as being of a type, if specified properties exist on it~\cites[pp.~101--102]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2015}[pp.~18--20]{ProJavaScriptDesignPatterns:HarmesDiaz:2008}. If, for example, a constructor function \emph{Person} is given, which defines a \emph{getName} property on its prototype, an arbitrary object could be considered as \emph{Person}, if it also provides a \emph{getName} property. This gets already closer to TypeScript's structural types (see Sec.~\ref{sec:typescript}).
  \item \textbf{Interface checking with generics:} This concept requires the definition of a class for every interface, which holds the property names to identify an object as having a specific type~\cites[pp.~102--105]{MasteringTypeScript:Rozentals:2015}[pp.~17--19]{ProJavaScriptDesignPatterns:HarmesDiaz:2008}. This solution is similar to the previous approach, but it introduces a pattern, which is more readable and maintainable.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Another mechanism is to use \textit{decorators}\footnote{\url{https://tc39.github.io/proposal-decorators}}, a JavaScript language feature proposal, which is currently at stage two~\cite{DecoratorsProposalRepo}, meaning that it is still a draft and not yet in the specification~\cite{EcmaScriptProposalProcess}. They can, however, already be used with TypeScript or tools like Babel~\cite{TypeScriptHandbook:Decorators, Babel:Plugins:Decorators}. The solution used in~\cite{DecoratorTypeChecks}, which makes use of decorators, again requires to add them to the source code manually. Furthermore, only primitive types and instances can be checked automatically. Structural type checks---e.g., for custom objects or interfaces---have to be provided by the developer.

\noindent
As runtime type checks are of importance for an application to be robust, the operators \texttt{typeof} and \texttt{instanceof} are often used to verify a value's type, which according to \citeauthor{DynamicTypeChecks:Rauschmayer:2017} is ``[...] less than ideal, because [it requires] to keep the difference between primitive values and objects in mind''~\cite{DynamicTypeChecks:Rauschmayer:2017}. Prog.~\ref{prog:runtime-checks-hasInstance} shows a technique to enable \texttt{instanceof} checks also for primitive values, such as strings. He further refers to using a library for checking types at runtime, and outlines two ECMAScript proposals that are related to runtime validations~\cite{DynamicTypeChecks:Rauschmayer:2017}, which are shown in Prog.~\ref{prog:runtime-checks-pattern-match} and Prog.~\ref{prog:runtime-checks-builtin}.

% All of these approaches have in common, that it requires developers to manually add checks, resulting in increased development effort.

\section{Generated Runtime Type Checks}
\label{sec:existing-projects}

During research, no libraries could be found which automatically generate runtime type checks from TypeScript code, and validations have to be implemented manually, as described in the previous section. However, there are libraries which aim to provide a runtime type system, which are explored in Sec.~\ref{sec:runtime-type-system}. While those packages are supportive in describing and validating data structures in JavaScript, few projects concentrate on automatically generating them. As it may not be feasible to create checks without the data provided by a static type system or some kind of supportive information---such as type annotations---also no libraries could be discovered which can provide runtime validations from native JavaScript code. However, the Babel plugins \emph{babel-plugin-tcomb}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/gcanti/babel-plugin-tcomb}} and \emph{babel-plugin-flow-runtime}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-flow-runtime}} can generate runtime validations for Flow syntax~\cites{RuntimeTypeSystem:tcomb:babel, RuntimeTypeSystem:flow-runtime:babel}. Furthermore, a future release of Babel will support TypeScript syntax~\cite{Babel:TypeScript}, which could make it possible to adapt the plugins to also transform TypeScript code.
